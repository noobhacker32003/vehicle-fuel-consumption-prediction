# Vehicle Fuel Consumption Prediction Using ML and AI

## Overview
This project aims to predict vehicle fuel consumption using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing historical data, we can accurately forecast future fuel usage. The project utilizes scikit-learn (sklearn) for implementing advanced algorithms and data modeling techniques.

## Algorithms Used
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**
